Upgrade from Fedora 21 to Fedora 24
===================================

Fedora 24 will be relased on June 21st.

I'm running an aging install of Fedora 21, and I have an SSD I bought
but never installed, going to waste.  Additionally, I never got the
video drivers working well enough to run Steam with any amount of
stability or performance.  Time to get moving.

Plan:

 - write me

Ideas:

 - Dual boot?  I never liked dual-boot for day-to-day usage, but it
   might be a good migration strategy for the transition period.

Long-standing issues:

 - I have to pass "iommu=soft" to the kernel when I boot, or
   everything is ten times slower.  I think this problem is particular
   to my motherboard.  A newer kernel may address this.
