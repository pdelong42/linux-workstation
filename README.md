This is where I keep track of what I want out of my home Linux
workstation.  It probably applies more generally, for example if I
were to set-up a Linux workstation at work, or a Linux laptop (though
the latter is fraught with extra caveats).

The reason I finally started keeping track of this is because I wanted
to deal with the problem of upgrading.  I dread upgrading.  Things
break, and while fixing that kind of stuff is what I do for a living,
I usually don't have time to deal with it in my personal life.  But
naturally, I want to reap the benefits of upgrading too (e.g., more
updated video drivers for Steam).

Here is where I plan to document the things I want to remain stable
across upgrades: any special software I have installed, any must-have
tools, any specific hardware support, and research on any replacements
for any of the above that happen to get discontinued (e.g., crony is a
replacement for ntpd).  Because let's face it: I forget these things,
and I need to write them down somewhere.

Largely, I use Fedora, because it strikes a nice balance between
stability and wide-ranging inclusion of repositories of lots of
pre-packagesd software.  While I do enjoy the occasional tinkering
with other more rough-and-tumble distros, I'd rather save that for
hardware that I don't depend on.  And if I cared about celebrity
endorsement, I could always point at Linus and cite that Fedora is the
distro he uses. ;-)
